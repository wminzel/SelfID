# 2. Introduction & Motivation

Digital identity is now the foundation of modern life, yet the systems we rely on remain fundamentally broken, insecure, and centralized. Every online service must create its own login system, store user credentials, manage passwords, and act as a gatekeeper for user data. This model is fragile, dangerous, and decades out of date.

### 2.1 The Problem Today

**Centralized Identity Control**  
A handful of corporations—Google, Apple, Meta—control the majority of logins across the internet. This gives them disproportionate power over user access, cross-site tracking, monetization, and censorship.

**Invasive Data Practices**  
Traditional authentication depends on personal information being stored in databases that are constantly breached. Passwords, email addresses, government IDs, and biometric data are all exposed to hacking and abuse.

**Siloed Credentials**  
Medical, academic, and professional credentials are locked inside institutions that act as gatekeepers. A doctor, researcher, or clinical trial participant cannot prove their status without the institution acting as the intermediary.

**No Global Interoperability**  
There is no universal identity standard that works across websites, countries, and industries.

### 2.2 Why SelfID

SelfID is designed to solve these core problems by providing:

- **User-owned identity**: A DID controlled by private keys, not companies or governments.
- **Zero-trust authentication**: Apps validate signatures, not user data.
- **No personal information on-chain**: Only public keys are stored in the registry.
- **Simple login**: A browser extension wallet handles identity just like crypto wallets handle currency.
- **Optional verifiable credentials**: A user can prove “I am a doctor” or “I am over 18” without exposing their identity.
- **Interoperability**: Any website can integrate SelfID with a simple API.

### 2.3 Historical Inspiration

Just as the early internet provided a universal communication layer, SelfID aims to provide a universal identity layer that is:

- **Decentralized** like the DNS protocol  
- **User-controlled** like cryptographic wallets  
- **Privacy-preserving** like zero-knowledge systems  

The evolution of blockchain and cryptographic standards enables a new class of identity systems—ones that remove intermediaries, protect users, and unlock entirely new applications.

SelfID represents the next phase of identity infrastructure:  
**secure, private, portable, and fully controlled by the individual.**
