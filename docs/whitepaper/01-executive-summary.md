# SelfID Whitepaper  
## 1. Executive Summary

SelfID is a decentralized, privacy-preserving identity layer designed to solve one of the most fundamental problems on the internet: secure, user-controlled authentication without relying on centralized platforms such as Google, Apple, Meta, or government identity systems.

Today’s identity infrastructure is fragmented, invasive, and insecure. Websites must store user data; companies track users across the web; password breaches are common; and medical, academic, or professional credentials are trapped inside institutions that act as gatekeepers.

SelfID provides:

- A decentralized identifier (DID) system (`did:selfid:*`)
- A lightweight, on-chain registry mapping DIDs to public keys
- A user-controlled wallet for signing authentication challenges
- Zero-trust, passwordless login that works on any website
- Optional verifiable credentials (e.g., “I am a doctor,” “I am over 18”)
- Privacy-preserving proofs that reveal no personal information

SelfID’s mission is to make global digital identity as universal and open as the internet itself.

Just as Google solved search, SelfID aims to solve identity — enabling users to control who they are online, without intermediaries.

This document describes the design goals, architecture, protocol, and next steps for SelfID’s development.
